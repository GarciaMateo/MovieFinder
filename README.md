<h1>MovieFinder</h1>

<p>This is a movie search web app, integrated with the TMDB database. It is developed entirely in vanilla JavaScript. It also has a functional login.</p>

<p>In order to run the app you must have the JSON server module installed. You can install it from <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server">here</a>. Once installed you must start a local server that monitors the db.json file.</p>

<p>The user that you must enter to be able to access through the login is:</p>
<ul>
<li>email: example@example.com</li>
<li>password: Example123-</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to enter with another user you need to add it to the db.json file that is on json_server folder.</p>
<p>In order to test the app it is recommended to use vscode with the Live Server module. To initialize the login you must open the file login.html in your browser.</p>
